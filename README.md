# build - A simple toolchain for AMD64.
This repository contains the source code of an x86 assembler and compiler.

The goal is to provide insights into how assemblers and compilers work without the complexity introduced by larger software projects.

## Warning
The tools are certainly not complete nor well tested. Do not use them in production, they are solely provided for educational purposes.
